### CPSC 120

* Lab 06 part-1

    My favorite lab this semester is without a doubt lab 06 part-1 and the reason why I enjoyed it so much was not completely due to the lab itself but it was also due to everything clicking to me at that point. In this lab I was able to do most of it because my partner was confused about it leaving me to trial and error until I finally clicked the different hings I could do to solve the problem at hand in my head. Using arguments.size for the first time in code was a door opener for me because there is so much I could do knowing the amount of arguments a user provided in the initial vector of arguments in the program. 

* Lab 07 part-1
    In second place lab 07 part-1 is a clear winner and this is due to how fun writing lots of code was for me. In this lab I was really able to spread my wings and was not very confined to what I could do. There were many different ways to solve the problem and I was able to pick the one I found most enjoyable and practical while also having the program work perfectly. This lab also expanded on what was taught in the lecture, that being the code arguments.at(). This along with arguments.size really opened my eyes to more programs I could do with the information given and showed me how it was possible to do things I did not think was possible before being able to store those values in variables for future use.

* Lab 09 part-1
    My last pick is lab 09 part-1 because of how fun making a lot of variables and using them at different parts of the script is for me. I love being able to make specific variables and use them at later points in the script to make my life easier manipulating numbers and this lab allowed me to do so with 75 lines of code in total. This lab was done while I was still getting used to loops and introduced a way to loop for every argument in the original argument vector which helped loops make more sense to me and for that reason I liked the lab a lot more.
